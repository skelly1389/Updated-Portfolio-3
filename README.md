# Revised Portfolio

## Description

After experimenting more with html and learning a bit about bootstrap and custom css classes I took the original portfolio and reformatted it to be both easier to read and scale better between mobile and desktop viewing.

## Installation

Clickable links to my profiles on github and linkedin as well as links to three of the best homeworks and projects I've completed in the course so far.
